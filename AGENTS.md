# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/app/` MUST contain Next.js App Router routes (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`).
- `src/components/` MUST contain UI and site sections; shared logic MUST live in `src/lib/` when appropriate.
- `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`, and `src/types/` MUST contain core logic, hooks, and types.
- `src/__tests__/` MUST contain Vitest unit and integration tests (`*.test.ts(x)`).
- `src/test/` and `src/mocks/` MUST contain test setup, helpers, factories, and MSW handlers.
- `public/` MUST contain static assets.
- `out/` MUST be treated as generated output and MUST NOT be edited manually.
- `infrastructure/` MUST contain the AWS CDK app and its independent tests and config.
- `scripts/` MUST contain build, deploy, and operational utilities.
- `docs/` MUST contain architecture decisions, specifications, and runbooks.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm install`: install dependencies (Node version follows `.nvmrc`).
- `pnpm dev`: run Next.js locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
- `pnpm build`: production build; generates image variants, writes static `out/`, and updates CSP hashes.
- `pnpm start` or `pnpm serve`: serve the static export in `out/`.
- `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format`: Biome linting and formatting.
- `pnpm type-check`: TypeScript validation.
- `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:coverage`: Vitest unit and integration coverage.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: Playwright tests in `e2e/`.

Infrastructure:

- `pnpm -C infrastructure install`: install infrastructure dependencies.
- `pnpm -C infrastructure test`: run the infrastructure Vitest suite.
- `pnpm -C infrastructure deploy:storage` and other `deploy:*`: deploy CDK stacks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript-first code MUST be the default, and changed code MUST stay strictly typed.
- Existing repo patterns MUST be preferred over new abstractions unless a new abstraction is clearly required.
- Biome formatting and linting rules in `biome.json` MUST be followed.
- React components MUST use `PascalCase.tsx`, hooks MUST use `useThing.ts`, and tests MUST use `*.test.ts(x)`.
- Unicode em dash `U+2014` MUST NOT be used; `--` MUST be used instead. Detect with `rg -n --pcre2 "\\x{2014}" .`.
- Floating promises MUST NEVER be introduced; code MUST use `await`, `return`, `.catch`, or `.then(..., onRejected)`.
  Prefer lint rule enforcement (e.g., `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`) for reliable
  detection. If using `rg`, note that `rg -n --pcre2 "Promise\\.resolve\\(\\)" .` is a narrow
  heuristic and will miss common cases like `fooAsync();`.
- Every changed or added exported TS/TSX symbol MUST have a `/** ... */` TSDoc block with no blank line before it.
- TSDoc summaries MUST be one sentence ending with `.`. Allowed tags are only:
  `@remarks @param @typeParam @returns @throws @example @see @deprecated` (order matters).
- TSDoc `@param` tags MUST use `@param name - desc` with no brace typing.
- If an exported function adds or changes a thrown error, it MUST include `@throws ErrorType - condition`.
- Barrel imports MUST NEVER be introduced from package entrypoints or `index` re-exports.
  Examples: `lucide-react`, `@mui/material`.
- Direct module paths MUST ALWAYS be used for imports (for example `lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/x` or `@mui/material/Button`).
- The only barrel-import exception is packages listed in `experimental.optimizePackageImports`;
  those MAY be used because Next rewrites them.
- Lucide icons MUST ALWAYS use direct `lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/*` imports.
- The Lucide typings shim at `src/types/lucide-react-icons.d.ts` MUST be preserved when those direct paths are used.

## Testing Guidelines

- App tests MUST use Vitest with `jsdom`.
- Coverage thresholds MUST be enforced by default and MAY only be changed via `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_DEFAULT` or `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_<METRIC>`.
- Infrastructure tests MUST be run from `infrastructure/` with the separate Vitest config.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages MUST follow Conventional Commits (for example `feat(infra): ...`, `fix(csp): ...`, `chore(deps): ...`).
- PRs MUST include a clear description, MUST link issues or ADRs when relevant, and MUST include screenshots for UI changes.
- Before committing or opening a PR, `pnpm lint && pnpm test` MUST be run.
- `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm test:e2e` MUST also be run when the change can affect those surfaces.

## Documentation Guidelines

- New ADRs MUST use `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0000-template.md`.
- New specs MUST use `docs/specs/SPEC-0000-template.md`.

## Security, Configuration, and Deployment Notes

- Secrets MUST NEVER be committed to git.
- `.env.local` MUST be used for local-only overrides, starting from `.env.example`.
- Tailwind CSS MUST use the v4 CSS-first configuration in `src/app/globals.css`.
- `tailwind.config.ts` MUST be treated as tooling-only unless it is explicitly loaded via `@config`.
- Static export is mandatory via `output: "export"`.
- Server Actions, ISR, Draft Mode, request-dependent Route Handlers, and any other
  server-runtime-only features MUST NOT be introduced.
- CSP inline script hashes are generated and are NOT secrets.
- `infrastructure/lib/generated/next-inline-script-hashes.ts` MUST NEVER be deleted or edited manually.
- CSP hashes MUST be regenerated with `pnpm generate:csp-hashes`, usually via `pnpm build`.
- Static export and CSP deployment steps MUST stay in sync:
  `pnpm build` -> `pnpm -C infrastructure deploy:storage` -> `pnpm deploy:static:prod`.
- Merges to `main` MUST preserve the GitHub Actions deployment flow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Browser Automation

`agent-browser` MUST be used for browser automation work.
`agent-browser --help` SHOULD be used when command syntax is needed.

Core workflow:

1. `agent-browser open <url>` - Navigate to page
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` - Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2)
3. `agent-browser click @e1` / `fill @e2 "text"` - Interact using refs
4. Re-snapshot after page changes

<!-- opensrc:start -->

## Source Code Reference

Dependency source code in `opensrc/` SHOULD be used when internal implementation details matter.
`opensrc/sources.json` MUST be treated as the index of fetched packages and versions.
Dependency source MUST be consulted when types or public docs are insufficient to understand behavior.

### Fetching Additional Source Code

To fetch source code for a package or repository you need to understand, run:

```bash
npx opensrc <package>           # npm package (e.g., npx opensrc zod)
npx opensrc pypi:<package>      # Python package (e.g., npx opensrc pypi:requests)
npx opensrc crates:<package>    # Rust crate (e.g., npx opensrc crates:serde)
npx opensrc <owner>/<repo>      # GitHub repo (e.g., npx opensrc vercel/ai)
```

<!-- opensrc:end -->
